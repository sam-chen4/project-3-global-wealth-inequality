# Analysis of Global Wealth Inequalities

Overview:

This project delves into the analysis of income inequality across different countries, examining how it correlates with economic indicators such as GDP and the Human Development Index (HDI). By comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID periods, this project aims to uncover insights into the factors influencing income disparity globally. The primary objectives are to visualize trends in income inequality over time, explore relationships between GDP and income inequality, and compare inequality across various regions.

Ethical Considerations:

This project takes ethical considerations seriously. The datasets used are publicly available and sourced from reputable institutions. Care has been taken to anonymize and protect any sensitive information. The analysis aims to provide insights that can inform better policies and practices for addressing income inequality, rather than reinforcing existing disparities. Furthermore, the visualizations and interpretations strive to be accurate and unbiased, presenting data in a manner that is clear and understandable to a wide audience.
